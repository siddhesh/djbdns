Mar 23 2009 pjp <prasad@redhat.com>

	* Released the second version djbdns-1.05.2 that includes all the
	  changes done so far.

Mar 20 2009 pjp <prasad@redhat.com>
	
	* dnsq.c: 
	  dnsip.c:
	  parsetype.c: Files edited to support few command line options and
	  are formatted to suit my coding style. Also the copyright disclaimer
	  added to the top.

	* dnsip.ms: new manuscript file added for dnsip.1. Manual page for
	  dnsip command.

	* dnsq.ms: new manuscript file added for dnsq.1. Manual page for
	  dnsq command.

	* Makefile.am: did append "version.h" to the dependencies of the
	  targets that required it.

	* byte_diff.c: did format it as per my taste of coding style.

	* query.c: Fixed a small bug I mistakenly introduced while formatting
	  this file. I removed a `pos = 0;' statement from line 552, thinking
	  that pos is getting initialised in the next statement, but that
	  stopped dnscache from processing `cname' type records and thus
	  resolving names. It took me whole day to figure that out.
	  Anyway...lesson learned. :)

	* dnscache.c:
	  droproot.c:
	  pickdns.c:
	  rbldns.c:
	  tinydns.c:
	  walldns.c: Did add 'extern short debug_level' declaration to all
	  these files.

	* version.h: version changed to 1.05.2, not yet released though.

Mar 17 2009 pjp <prasad@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am: changed to install `dnsip' command.

	* dnscache.c: changed to include the new "version.h" file. It defines
	  the VERSION macro.

	* dnsip.c: changed to process command line options with getopt, and
	  display help menu etc.

	* version.h: new file defines the VERSION macro.

	* alloc.c:
	  alloc.h:
	  buffer.c:
	  buffer.h:
	  buffer_1.c:
	  buffer_put.c:
	  buffer_write.c:
	  cache.c:
	  dd.c:
	  dnscache.c:
	  fmt_ulong.c:
	  iopause.c:
	  ip4.h:
	  ip4_fmt.c:
	  log.c:
	  okclient.c:
	  prot.c:
	  query.c:
	  roots.h:
	  str.h:
	  str_chr.c:
	  str_rchr.c: fixed the str_rchr() function to go from `end to start'
	  while looking for the given character.
	  
	  All the above files are formatted as per the coding style
	  convenient to me. Also did add the copyright disclaimer at the top.

Mar 13 2009 pjp <prasad@redhat.com>
	
	* response.c: patched with the latest Matthew Dempsky patch available
	  at: http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=123613000920446&w=2
		
		if (response_len < 16384) ...

	* Makefile.am: changed to install `dnstracesort' script.

	* dns_transmit.c: patched with the `d->pos = 0' and `char udpgbuf[4096]
	  patch from Matthew Dempsky. Did add the copyright disclaimer at the
	  top.
	  http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=119983010611174&w=3
	  http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=122368590802063&w=2

	* dnscache.c: patched with the SIGPIPE patch from Mark Delany. Did add
	  copyright disclaimer at the top.
	  http://marc.info/?l=djbdns&m=104804013229536&w=2

	* error.h: patched to #include <errno.h> on Linux machines. Did add
	  copyright disclaimer at the top.

	* COPYING: changed to GPL version 2, instead of version 3.

	* dnscache.c: automatic local variable named `mode' renamed to `perm'
	  in couple of functions as there is already a global variable named
	  mode.

	* readme.ms: changed to reference a web-link wherein DJB put his work
	  in public-domain. Obviously, the same goes to README.

Mar  3 2009 pjp <prasad@redhat.com>

	* This new release is djbdns version 1.05.1. The new build system makes
	  use of the GNU auto-tools and is fully integrated with the linux
	  /sbin/service.

	* dnscache.c: reads configuration file: PREFIX/etc/djbdns/dnscache.conf
	  PREFIX is the install prefix used by ./configure command.

	* dnscache.c: changed to create log-file under /var/log, pid-file under
	  /var/run and also to accept some command-line options.
	  
	  See dnscache --help

	* Commands removed:
		dnscache-conf

	* Source files removed:
		auto-str.c
		cachetest.c
		chkshsgr.c
		hier.c
		install.c
		instcheck.c
		trycpp.c
		trydrent.c
		trylsock.c
		trypoll.c
		tryshsgr.c
		trysysel.c
		tryulong32.c
		tryulong64.c
		utime.c
		x86cpuid.c

	* Hi, I take this source of original djbdns-1.05, as is, from

		http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html
	
	  and aim is to free it from the daemon of `daemontools', make it as
	  much independent & concise as possible and thus more usable and
	  maintainable.
