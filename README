                                 =============



          Hello all,

               I   am   pleased  to  release  this  *new*  version  of
          djbdns-1.05.1.  Djbdns  is  a  fully-fledged   Domain   Name
          System(DNS),  originally  written  by  the eminent author of
          qmail, Dr. D J Bernstein. This new  release  is  a  complete
          makeover to the original source(djbdns-1.05) and is meant to
          make life a lot more pleasant. The notable  changes  so  far
          are  in  the  set-up  &  configuration  steps.  The original
          source is in public-domain since late Dec 2007.

               Please see: http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html

          Nevertheless, this new release is distributed under the  GNU
          General  Public  Licence  for  good. See ChangeLog  for more
          details.

          Installation:
          -------------

          To install djbdns: just say

               sh>$ ./configure [ --prefix=/usr/local ]
               sh>$ make
               sh># make install

          Once installed, On Linux  machines  add  ‘dnscache’  to  the
          system  services by following steps. Note that, if you chose
          a different install prefix with ‘--prefix’  use  that  while
          creating the link with ln.

               sh># ln -s /usr/local/bin/djbdns /etc/init.d/djbdns
               sh># chkconfig --add djbdns
               sh># chkconfig --list djbdns

          Now you can start the service by

               sh># service djbdns start
                        OR
               sh># dnscache -D

          Consult the dnscahce(1) manual page for more help.


          Problems:
          ---------

               If  you  encounter any problems while installing djbdns
          OR find any bugs in working of djbdns, please send an  email
